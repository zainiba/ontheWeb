    <h2>About On The Web</h2>
    <p>It is so easy to get lost on the Web, we move from one link to the next one that catches our interest. Capturing the users attention with words and images has been broken down into a science. The titles on this page are from my own expirience of Youtube binge. What seems like minutes turns into hours of web surfing and it doesn't look like you'll ever stop.</p>
